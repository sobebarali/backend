Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go.

We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed!

The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go.

We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.


Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed!

The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.

Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order. Discipline teaches us to plan ahead, to prepare meals or grab something quick when running late instead of just grabbing something unhealthy on the go. It takes discipline to think ahead about what we will eat before going out with friends or what we will have as a snack at home while watching TV. It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It takes discipline to turn off the TV and go to sleep, it takes discipline to leave work on time, it takes discipline to say no to a second glass of wine. Discipline teaches us habits that will keep us safe and healthy and protect our loved ones.

Family, job, education, religion, everything requires discipline. Discipline helps us to stay calm and focused when other people want to distract us from our goals. By being disciplined in everything we do, we are asserting control over our actions, which allows us to be more effective at everything we do. We should always be striving to create a better life for ourselves and for those around us through discipline and respect for all life (discipline comes from Greek dikein=to divide, distribute divinity.)

In the book “The Healthy School Lunch”, author Ellen Booth Church wrote: “Discipline is the ability to listen with an open mind and a willingness to consider other ideas or ways of looking at things. It also involves taking responsibility. It is the strength of character that enables us to set priorities, and work hard to achieve them.”

Discipline gives one the ability to be successful in life. Discipline leads you to your own path and helps you change yourself into what you want to be. It allows you to stay focused and positive throughout the entire process. Discipline can be defined as a strong desire for self-improvement, without being sadistic or controlling. If one truly desires improvement, they can discipline themselves in order to become better at whatever they are doing.


If you want to discipline yourself and improve your life, there are some ways to start.

1. Start by developing a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy, exercise, and drink plenty of water.

2. Set a time to go to the gym and set a goal of going at least 3 times a week; finish up any rounds you’re not able to complete, then start again next time.

3. Keep track of your daily caloric intake and burn using an app on your phone or computer – this is especially important if you are trying to lose or gain weight or are just trying to get fit/healthy.

4. Get up and move every 30 minutes during the night; get active to help with sleep; this way you will be more likely to get enough sleep each night.

5. Think about what you are going to eat – make meals ahead of time so that you have a healthy meal ready for when you get home or pack some healthy snacks for later in the day or week. Eat your healthy meals and snacks as often as possible so that they become a habit.

6. Make sure that the life you live is one that you want.


7. Ask yourself what you want out of life and what you need to have a healthy, happy life; listen to your body and don’t let it dictate your path.

8. Give yourself healthy alternatives to food reasons as opposed to unhealthy reasons; if feeling sad or bored, take a walk instead of eating chocolate – if feeling burnt out at work, go for a swim instead of grabbing an ice cream -if feeling unmotivated, take up some hobbies instead of watching TV or staying in bed all day – know that there are healthier options to consider when situations arise.

9. Don’t panic – if you want to change, it will take some time, have faith in yourself and your ability to change!

10. Most importantly, be patient with yourself! You are human and you will have times when it’s hard to stick to schedules or follow plans; just pick up where you left off and try again. Don’t beat yourself up when you slip up or fall off the wagon (just metaphorically speaking). It’s okay to have bad days – they happen; it’s normal. You don’t need to be perfect in order to succeed! All you need is a good attitude, persistence and consistency.

Once you develop these habits, discipline and a healthy lifestyle, you can see that a healthy life is a goal. “We have not yet ventured to the heart of life, the beauty and grandeur of creation, but we are generating the highest levels of discipline, and aiming straight for a healthy lifestyle.” -T.G. Tull.



Discipline is the trait of showing self-control and taking responsibility for your actions.

“Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be.”
The moment you are disciplined, you will have the power to discipline yourself to take care of your needs and do what is necessary, whether it’s in regards with work, relationships or health. There are many ways that discipline can help us with our lives. Our brains are like computers – they need constant input from external sources: food, sunlight, water… Discipline teaches us to give our bodies what they need to keep us happy.

Discipline is more than just training that we undertake to prepare ourselves for something. It embodies our commitment to work hard and to be the best person we can be. It takes a powerful personality, passion and drive. Discipline can help individuals accomplish tasks that they never dreamed possible and it also enables them to overcome obstacles, which might otherwise be unsurmountable.

Discipline is defined as habitual self-control in opposing a natural desire or tendency; the act of disciplining; self-control in training oneself. Discipline is a way of life, not a lecture; it grows out of character and habit; it is best taught by example rather than by precept; reward or punishment should never be used.

It is not always easy to discipline yourself and stick to a healthy lifestyle but it’s much easier when you set good habits and routines for yourself. Good habits are essential for a good life – you should develop the habit of being on time, of tidying up after your activities, of keeping your things in order.
